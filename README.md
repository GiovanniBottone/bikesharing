## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a proposal to solidify investors for a bike-sharing program implementation in Des Moines, Iowa. Using NYC data, we were tasked with creating visualizations for investors to further their understanding. One key stakeholder requested three specific visualizations:
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

The first point of interest for the analyis was gathering the top starting locations for all bike sharing users. Gathering this information helps develop a deeper understanding of user trends and highlights locations where additional bike racks may be necessary.

The next point of interest was gathering the top ending locations for all bike sharing users. By combining the top starting and ending locations, we can identify the most common bike sharing routes, and identify locations where additional bike racks may be necessary.

Checkout times for users highlight the most common trip duration, which can be used to develop a better understanding of the users intentions and for depreciation and usage forecasting. In this case, the most common trip duration is 5 minutes, which tells us that the typical user relies on bike sharing primarily for short distance travel.

A comparison of trip quantity per day, by hour, can be used to identify busy and slow periods. Once these times have been established, bike sharing companies will have a much better understanding of ideal maitenance times.

A gender breakdown provides an additional level of understanding of the bike sharing clientele, which can be used for future promotional campaigns to attract the less active gender. In this case, promotional campaigns would be female focused due to the currently male dominated clientele.

Gathering information on customer vs subscriber user-types provides a unique clientele view for the bike sharing companies. In this instance, the majority of users are subscribers, which benefits the bike sharing company. However, if the majority of users are customers, the bike sharing company could see a significant usage decrease due to lack of subscription. Growth forecasts vary heavily based on which user-type dominates the clientele.

A consistent trend across all users is higher bike sharing usage during typical work commute hours and weekends, with much lower bike sharing usage during work and rest hours.

## Summary
From our research, a safe assumption is majority of users are commuters, not tourists. This assumption is based on the heavy usage rates during typical work commute hours, which benefits the bike sharing company because the majority of their business should remain consistent. An additional takeaway from this research is that the majority of users are male, which should point marketing campaigns toward female clientele. One unique point is the most common ride duration is 5 minutes, which shows that the majority of usage is for short distance travel. A substantial growth opportunity can be created if users can be convinced to bike share for longer distances. The shorter ride duration can be NYC biased, due to the large number of shops and restaurants in short radius from one another. Since Des Moines, Iowa is very different from NYC based on layout, it is likely that ride duration would increase substantially.
